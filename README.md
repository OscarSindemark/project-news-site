# News Site

We had to create a news website in this assignment. My website is about Cats and Tattoos!

## The problem

I had a lot of problems, namely the navbar. I looked up so many different css-only navbar tutorials and codepens and everyone does it so differently that I just don't really get it. I messed up the media queries with that, because I wanted to hide the hamburger fold-out on everything but mobile. I would go back and add more detail to the title, get a logo, and figure out the media query hamburger thing if I had more time.
